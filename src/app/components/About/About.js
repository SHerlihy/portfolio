Oops, forgot to tell you about myself. Long ago in the ancient past of
2006, I inadvertantly ignited my passion for technology by choosing to
take an experimental course of studies in computer networking in
school. Despite many a long night spend on my homeworks the course the
school decided to discontinue the course and all I can remember of it
is an acronym involving sausage pizzas. However, I did get to spend a
couple of week in the summer on a work placement in the school helping
the IT admin "ghost" the computers.
<br />
<br />
My second encounter with technology came many years later during my
materials science and engineering degree. Descriptions for potential
final year projects were posted and I was keen to apply for a less
popular project evaluating a simulation of a metallic 3D printing
process (only one other person applied). Up to this point my
experience of programming was limited to a single module that only
lasted for one semester on the basics of Matlab two years prior. I was
confronted with a behemoth written in C#. I was no programming prodigy
and the many lines of code made little sense to me until I started to
recognise a few mathematical equations that were being used. From
these familiar equations I was able to see they were being used in
functions and that the code had created a matrix. For clarity, I am
brushing over a couple of months of frustration and late nights
interacting with and studying the code. To bring a long story to a
brief close, I was able to gain a first in my project module due to my
evaluation of the programme; all without ever reading a thing about
C#.

Years passed and I had finished finished my studies in teacher
training when I caught the technology bug again. I enjoyed teaching
but I felt I could do more that ferry about 100 kids through their
science GCSEs every year. I wanted something more intellectually
stimulating, something that could benefit the lives of millions. I was
browsing books in the supermarket when my eye was drawn away to a
magazine "Python: The Complete Guide" (or something similar). I read
the thick magazine and completed some of the tutorial before I
starting thinking seriously about pursuing a career in programming. I
went online, did a lot of googling, watched may a YouTube video and
concluded I was going to become a front-end web developer familiar
with the MERN stack. Well, I'm not going to disclose the amount of
time between my revelation and the current moment I type this epic
tale but I will reveal I am a new front-end web developer with
experience developing applications using the MERN stack (and I've also
used a little socket.io too). */
